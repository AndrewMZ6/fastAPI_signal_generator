# fastAPI_signal_generator
fast api service for getting typical signals  
The application is used to fast get typical OFDM signals for testing purposes remotely  

Future plans:		
- define endpoints for OFDM with pilots 
- define endpoints for OFDM without pilots
- define endpoints for QAM modulation  

Libs used:
- Numpy
- Commpy
- FastApi (and it's dependencies)
